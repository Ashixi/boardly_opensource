Last Updated: January 11, 2026

This document constitutes a legally binding agreement between you (the User) and the developer of Boardly. By using the application, you agree to the terms described below.

1. Account Registration and Security
To use Boardly, you must create an account using a valid email address.

Registration and account recovery are performed via a one-time 6-digit verification code sent to your email.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities performed under your account.

2. Service Description
Boardly is an online collaboration platform that allows users to work together on interactive boards.

The application uses peer-to-peer (P2P) communication based on WebRTC technology to synchronize data directly between users’ devices.

Boardly does not store or inspect content transmitted directly between users.

3. Plans and Access Levels
Free Plan: provides access to the collaboration service with limited capacity, including one active board and a limited number(4 peers) of simultaneous participants.

Paid Plans: expand the limits of the online collaboration and synchronization service, including an increased number of boards and participants, subject to technical limitations.

Paid plans do not unlock local application features, but increase the available capacity of the online service.

4. Payments and Subscriptions
Payments for paid plans are processed via our authorized third-party payment provider, Stripe.

Boardly does not collect, process, or store payment card data directly; all transactions are handled securely by Stripe.

Subscription activation occurs automatically after confirmation from the payment provider.

Refunds and subscription cancellations are governed by the applicable Terms of Service of Stripe and Boardly.

Subscriptions may be assigned to other users by specifying their public account identifiers.

5. Acceptable Use
You retain full ownership of all content you create or transmit through the application.

You are solely responsible for the legality, security, and integrity of any data shared with other users.

Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:

distribution of malware or malicious code;

infringement of intellectual property rights;

transmission of illegal or harmful content.

6. Intellectual Property
All rights to the application, including its source code, design, visual elements, logos, and the Boardly name, are owned by the developer.

Reverse engineering, decompilation, modification, or redistribution of the application without explicit written permission is prohibited.

7. Limitation of Liability
Connection Stability: Boardly does not guarantee uninterrupted connectivity, as P2P connections depend on user hardware, network configuration, and internet providers.

Third-Party Services: Boardly is not responsible for failures or disruptions caused by third-party services, including Stripe (payment processing), Google STUN servers, or Coturn TURN servers.

Data Loss: Users are responsible for maintaining their own backups. Boardly is not liable for loss of data due to technical failures.

8. Privacy Policy and Data Processing
Personal Data: Boardly stores the email address, username, public user identifier, and a securely hashed and salted password.

Technical Data: During active P2P sessions, technical network information (such as IP addresses) may be exchanged via ICE servers solely to establish direct connections. This data is not stored after the session ends.

File Metadata: We reserve the right to collect anonymous data regarding the type and size of files processed within the application solely for the purpose of service optimization and performance improvement. This does not include the contents of the files.

Data Deletion: Users may delete their accounts at any time through application settings. Upon deletion, all associated data is permanently removed from Boardly’s systems.

9. Termination
Boardly reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to an account in the event of violations of these Terms.
